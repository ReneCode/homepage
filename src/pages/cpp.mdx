# Cpp

function call makes a copy of the parameters

```Cpp

bool checkNumber(int x) {
  ... 
}

....
int val = 17;
if (checkNumber(val)) {
  ...
}

```

But for performance reasonses it could be fine to take the reference to the parameter value. In normal you don't want to change that vaue in the function so you will write:

```Cpp
bool checkObject(MyObject const& obj) {
  // that will fail - because of const
  obj = new MyObject();
}
```


</Layout>
