# Graph Database Neo4j

Using relation databases is boring – working with document databases is more intuitiv. But really cool is using a graph database.

So take the database that is currently available – [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/).

## Runing Neo4j

We could install it, but we have docker – so use the docker-image [neo4j](https://hub.docker.com/_/neo4j/).

A simple docker-compose.yml file looks like:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  neo4j:
    image: neo4j
    ports:
      - "7474:7474"
      - "7473:7473"
      - "7687:7687"
    volumes:
      - ~/data:/data
      - ~/logs:/logs
```

Start it with:

```
docker-compose up
```

The port 7474 and 7473 are for the web-interface of neo4j. Port 7687 is for accessing the data from our application. But first change the default-user for neo4j.

Login to localhost://7474 with user=neo4j, password=neo4j and change user and password.

## Using Neo4j

There are a lot of JS drivers for neo4j. Let’s start with the official driver:

```
yarn add neo4j-driver
```

Now we are able to use the database:

```js
const neo4j = require('neo4j-driver').v1

const uri = 'bolt://localhost:7687'
const user = 'my-new-user'
const password = 'my-new-password'

const driver = neo4j.driver(uri, neo4j.auth.basic(user, password))
const session = driver.session()
```
The session is the main point we will use.

### Nodes

First create a node:

```js
const resultPromise = session.run(
  'CREATE (a:Person {name: $name})',
  {name: "Susan"}
)

resultPromise.then(result => {
  session.close()
})
```
No big deal. But now – if you to to localhost:7474 – you can query that data in the browser:

```
MATCH (n) RETURN N LIMIT 50
```
	
This gets all data – not all, just 50.


### Relations

Now create a realation: „Susan knows Paul“

```js 
session.run(
  'CREATE (a:Person {name: $name}) - [:knows] -> (b:Person {name: $otherName})',
  { 
    name: "Susan", 
    otherName: "Paul"
  }
)
.then( x => {
  console.log('finished')
  driver.close()
})
```

That’s fine. We have two nodes: Susan and Paul, and a relation (with direction) between them.
But stop – there is a third node: Susan – That is the node we create first.

If we want to create a relation from/to an existing node we have to work in an other way.

```
MATCH (a) WHERE a.name ="Susan" CREATE (a) - [:knows]-> (b:Person{name:"Paul"})
```

* query that node you want to work with and name it (a)
* create relation using that ’node-reference‘ (a)

Deleting a node is done in the same way:

```
MATCH (a) WHERE a.name = "Paul" DETACH DELETE (a)
```
